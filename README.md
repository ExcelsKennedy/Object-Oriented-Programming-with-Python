# OOP with Python 
This is my first OOP for beginners tutorial. It has covered the four principles of OOP which are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance. 
I have worked on Items, Phones, Keyboard in their respective files and there is a CSV file to store the list of the items. 
The file main.py is for running the codes and testing them.
